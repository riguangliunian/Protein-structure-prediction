# Protein-structure-prediction
## Introduction
This project uses a hybrid neural network model that integrates Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Multi-Head Attention (MHA) to predict the secondary structure of proteins.


## Requirements
gensim==4.3.2  
numpy==1.23.5  
pandas==1.5.3  
scikit-learn==1.2.2  
scipy==1.11.2  
tensorflow==2.13.0  
keras==2.13.1  
torch==2.0.1+cu118  
python==3.10

we need to configure a GPU with about 40G memory to fully realize the running of all codes.
